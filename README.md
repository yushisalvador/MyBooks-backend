# Setup

- Clone and open this repository by running the following command on your terminal.

```
https://github.com/yushisalvador/libraryapp-backend.git
cd libraryapp-backend
code .
```

- Run `npm install` in your root directory to install the needed dependencies.

### Setting up the database.

- To use this api, you will need Postgres installed. You will need Postgres installed. If you haven't installed it already, download and install the [PostgresApp](https://postgresapp.com/) and verify its working by running the command psql in your terminal.
- Once you got your psql set up, log in to your postgres account in your terminal, and create a database called "library" by running `CREATE DATABASE library;`
- Once you got your database set up, exit the psql terminal and run `npx knex migrate: latest` to run the migrations, and `npx knex seed:run` to run the seeds (optional)

### Environment variables

- Create a .env file on your root directory with the following information:

```
DB_USER= postgres username
DB_PASSWORD= postgres password
DB_NAME=library
PORT=9000
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=random access token
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=random refresh token

```
### Start server
- To sart the server, run ``` npm run dev ``` . This command will start the server with nodemon.
